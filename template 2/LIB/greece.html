    <h2>Athens</h2>
    
    <br>
      <p> Difficult to summarize what to do in Athens, Greece, because of the number of attractions in the city, whether for those looking for history, for those who prefer fun or for those who want to know the Greek way of life.</p>
      <p>Add to this the fact that, unfortunately, many people like me spend little time in the capital prioritizing the Greek islands paradise. Yes, this happens to a lot of people when it comes to putting together the script and with me it was no different. I stayed only two full days in Athens, but it was enough to get the taste of want more. And I'm still coming back!</p>

<h2>WHAT TO DO IN ATHENS, GREECE</h2>

      <p>Before we properly list the 10 tips of what to do in Athens, it's worth talking about the city. Lots of people had told me that she was not big things there, that apart from the Acropolis and other archeological sites, there was not much to like from there. Mistake.</p>


      <p>I found Athens a very interesting, lively, pulsating city ... of course it suffers from problems of many of the great cities of the world, but besides sweeping sights and history wherever you look, it is very nice to enjoy the rhythm of the Greek capital, restaurants, bars, museums and charming neighborhoods. It was a pleasant surprise!</p>

      <h2>1. ACRÓPOLE</h2>
      <p>You can not talk about what to do in Athens without thinking about the Acropolis. Postcard not only of the city, but of all of Greece, the "high city" is 150m above sea level and can be seen practically from the entire Greek capital.</p>

      <p>The most famous acropolis in the world was built in 450 BC and was dedicated to Athena, goddess patron of the city. Among the most consecrated monuments are Propileu, Erecteion and, of course, the Parthenon, symbol of Greece and European civilization.</p>

<p>The time spent to visit the archaeological site depends on your degree of interest in Ancient Greece. There are those who go up the hill to take some photos at the main points, enjoy the view and come back at noon. There are others who even visit the Acropolis on more than one day.
I bought the ticket on time, no problem. Try to go early or late in the afternoon to avoid the crowds. Those who go by subway can choose the entrance near the Acropoli station. There is no mistake. If you still want to know more and see the archaeological findings of this area, worth a visit to the Acropolis Museum.</p>

<h2>2. TEMPLE OF OLYMPIC ZEUS</h2>
      <p>Near the Acropolis, two blocks from the Acropoli subway, this temple was one of the greatest of antiquity, built as a devotion to Zeus. The building had 104 columns of 17m high, and 16 of them are still preserved.</p>


      <p>The famous Hadrian's Arch is right next door, in honor of the Roman emperor who completed the construction of the temple around the year 131 AD.</p>
 
      <h2>3. PANATENAIC STADIUM</h2>
      <p>Within walking distance of the attractions mentioned above, I went on foot even, the Panatenaico Stadium is one of the oldest in the world, dating from 566 BC The antique wooden benches were replaced by white marble about two hundred years later, with capacity for up to 50 thousand people.</p>




      <p>At the end of the 19th century, the structure was excavated and restored to the revival of the games in 1870 and 1875. The stadium was also used in 1896, in what is known as the first Olympic Games of the modern era.</p>
 

      <h2>4. AGORA OF ATHENS AND ROMAN AGORA</h2>
<p>In antiquity, there were two Agoras in the Greek capital, which were open spaces that contained important buildings of the political and social life of the city. One was the Ancient Agora of Athens, from the 6th century BC, and the other was already under Roman rule, the Roman Agora, built in the 1st century BC by Emperor Augustus and later enlarged by Hadrian. The two are close to each other in the famous Plaka neighborhood.</p>


<p>The Agora of Athens was the center of the city, important place for debates and decision making that involved politics, religion and even plays and sports competitions. The Roman Agora served as a place where the Athenians discussed matters relating to the city, such as laws, public works, among others.</p>


 
      <h2>5. PLAKA</h2>
<p>As I mentioned before, Plaka is one of the most famous and coolest neighborhoods for anyone visiting Athens. Because of this, it is also one of the best neighborhoods to stay in the city, with an incredible view of the Acropolis (see hotels in the region with up to 50% discount).</p>





<p>The alleys of Plaka form a veritable hall full of small shops, restaurants and bars. Some streets are closed only for tourists and this makes the tour even better. Get ready for a little saltier prices and also to bargain a lot, after all is the best places to buy souvenirs.</p>

<h2>6. MONASTIRAKI</h2>

<p>Neighbor to Plaka, this is one of the most famous commercial districts of ancient Athens. Monastiraki Square is one of the liveliest in the Greek capital, with the subway station of the same name and several shops and restaurants. The name of this small district is given by an old monastery that was in place.</p>




<p>Today the lull gave way to a frenzied return of tourists and locals. Some of the main attractions are the Flea Market, the Tzistarakis Mosque (where today the Greek Museum of Folk Art works), Hadrian's Library and Roman Agora.</p>




<p>But the best of Monastiraki when you want to know what to do in Athens is to walk aimlessly through the streets of popular commerce, to fill up old pieces or handicrafts, not to mention the gastronomy. Both during the day and at night, the streets are full of people in search of the restaurants of the neighborhood, especially in Adrianou Street.</p>



 
 


<h2>7. MONTE LICABETO</h2>
<p>Located in a noble neighborhood, Mount Lycabettus is the highest point in Athens, at 277 meters above sea level. Tourists can take a funicular from the Kolonaki district to the top of the hill. The trip is pretty cool, with some "special effects".</p>


<p>At the top of the hill, besides the viewpoints with views of the whole region, there are some good restaurants and a chapel. If you want to come by subway, the stations closest to the Lycabettus Funicular are Evangelismos and Panepistimio.</p>
 


<h2>8. THE GREEK CUISINE</h2>
<p>You can not come to Athens and not taste the Greek cuisine, right? And the city has many options for every type of pocket. Even in Plaka or in Monastiraki you will find good prices and delicious dishes. Adrianou Street, although touristy, has a great variety.</p>
<p>Be sure to sample the moussaka, which is probably the most famous Greek dish. It is a kind of lasagna, but without mass, that takes eggplants, lamb, white sauce and other delicacies.</p>
<p>If you like Greek yogurt, the industrialized one sold in Brazil, you will fall in love when you taste it straight from the source. In any restaurant it is available on the menu and not only for dessert. Often accompanied with savory dishes.</p>
<p>Souvlaki and gyros are relatively similar. While the first is a churrasquinho served on pita bread, the other is our famous Greek barbecue, which comes inside the bread, but here it is delicious and very cheap.</p>
<p>Finally, you can not talk about Greece without talking about the Greek salad, right? The feta cheese here is really amazing!</p>
