<h2>BUDAPEST </h2>

<p>If you want to know what to do in Budapest, you've come to the right place. In this post, we will give tips on the main attractions of the city and talk about our experience there.</p>

<p>Budapest, the capital of Hungary, has historic sites, cool bars and an incredible look. It is a journey that can please various types of tastes. And you know what the good news is? It is one of the cheapest destinations in Europe, as we already told in another post. But enough talk, let's go to tips.</p>

<h2>WHAT TO DO IN BUDAPEST</h2>
<p>First of all, it is important to understand that the city is divided by the Danube River into Buddha and Pest. The busiest part is in Pest, like restaurants, bars and shopping streets. It was much better for us to have stayed in this part of the city. We stayed at the Amber Gardenview Studios which is a simple but very comfortable apart hotel. It is worth taking a look.</p>

<h3>Things to do in Budapest</h3>

<p>Already in Buda is where is the Castle of Budapest. You will probably go there only to visit the Castle. So our suggestion is to stay on the Pest side to be easier to move to the other attractions and also to enjoy the night more. But, if it's better for you.</p>

<h2>PONTE SZÉCHENYI LÁNCHID </h2>
<p>If there is one thing that has much in Budapest is bridge, but the Széchenyi Lánchíd, known as Chain Bridge, is special. Located on the Danube River, it was the first link between the Buddha side and the Pest side. The bridge has existed since 1849 and is beautiful. It is worth walking through it and also watching it from afar during the day and at night. On one side of the bridge is Roosevelt Square and the other on Adam Clark Square.</p>


<h2>PONTOON - SUNSET</h2>
<p>For those who like to enjoy a beautiful sunset (we love them anywhere in the world), a good tip - especially in the summer, of course - is the Pontoon. Located just below the Széchenyi Lánchíd Bridge, the bar, which has an open and closed area, has music, food and cold beer. Good request for those who want to enjoy the end of a hot day and see the lights of the bridge light up. A half liter beer, for example, cost € 2.20 when we were there in June 2018.</p>

<h2>WALL FLOOR</h2>
<p>Tram ride is one of the most fun outings to do in Budapest. And prettier too. Besides we usually like trams (the two of us here on the blog, for example, we can not see a streetcar that we have already taken desperately photographing ), "number 2" is even cooler. This is because it runs a great path on the banks of the Danube. So the view is worth it. I think this must have been one of the few times we've been on the streetcar. Otherwise, we took the subway or walked.</p>



<h2>EAT GOULASH, PÁPRICA AND LANGOS</h2>
<p>I know this is a list with things to do in Budapest, but I already need to talk about food. One of the main dishes of the city is the goulash, which is nothing more than a soup sparse meat. I liked it a lot, but Rafa did not like it very much. He found it bland. It may be that we have not been very lucky in the two experiences we had there.</p>


<p>Paprika is something special in Hungarian cuisine. So, do not forget to try any dish that has the seasoning and also be sure to bring it to Brazil. We ate the galuska, a pasta that reminds us a bit of gnocchi, accompanied by chicken with paprika sauce or meat.</p>

<p>In addition, we ate a dish that came with different types of meats, sausages, sausages. All with enough paprika. Who says there's no candy there? The Gelarto Rosa was created by Niki Szökrön, besides being a delicious ice cream, it always comes in the shape of roses. (End .: 1051 Budapest, Szent István tér 3) I left for the end what we like to eat in Budapest: the lobsters !! It is practically a fried esfiha. The stuffing we ate was with sour cream, cheese and a mouthwatering garlic paste. We eat almost every day.</p>
   <p>When I saw the neo-baroque construction, I could not imagine that inside it would be the most famous thermal baths in Budapest. Dating back to 1913, the Széchenyi Hot Springs are located in City Park and are considered some of the largest thermal spas in Europe. Among the components of the spas are sulfate, calcium, magnesium and bicarbonate.</p>

<h2>SYNAGOGUE</h2>
<p>Another tip of what to do in Budapest is to go to the Synagogue, the largest in Europe and one of the largest in the world with capacity for about 3 thousand people. Located in the Jewish quarter, the space also serves as a museum. During World War II, the synagogue suffered serious damage.</p>

 

<h2>GOZSDU UDVAR (Boulevard with bars and restaurants)</h2>
<p>One of the funniest places in Budapest, the Gozsdu Udvar is an area of the Jewish quarter with many local and international bars and restaurants. There we found good options of bars for beer and wine. It is worth going there in the late afternoon and then closing the night in some bar in the ruins of the city.</p>


<h2>THE BUDAPEST EYE</h2>
<p>For those who love the Ferris wheel, there is also a Budapest Eye in Budapest. With tickets starting at 9 euros, you can have a beautiful view of the city from above. On the official website, you have more information. (End .: Budapest, Erzsébet tér, 1051 Hungary).</p>
