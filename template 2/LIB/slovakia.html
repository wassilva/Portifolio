    <h2>Slovakia </h2>
      <h5><b>Bratislava </b></h5>
   
      <p>Bratislava is the capital of Slovakia. With a population of about 430,000, it is one of the smaller capitals of Europe but still the country's largest city.[1] The greater metropolitan area is home to more than 650,000 people. Bratislava is in southwestern Slovakia, occupying both banks of the River Danube and the left bank of the River Morava. Bordering Austria and Hungary, it is the only national capital that borders two sovereign states.

<p>The city's history has been influenced by people of many nations and religions, including Austrians, Bulgarians, Croats, Czechs, Germans, Hungarians, Jews, Serbs[5] and Slovaks.[6] It was the coronation site and legislative center of the Kingdom of Hungary from 1536 to 1783,[7] and has been home to many Slovak, Hungarian and German historical figures.</p>

      <h2>Bratislava, script and practical tips.</h2>
      
<p>Here is the most useful post in the blogosphere world about everything you need to know to take a bump in Bratislava and back (if they are around).
      How to get to the city:</p>

<h2>By Airplane:</h2>

<p>Bratislava has a small airport, mainly served by low cost airlines, about 10 km from the city center. It is a great arrival point to visit the region, for malta not anything in money (the others go to Vienna).</p>
<p>The airport is served by two bus lines, number 96 and number 61. Take the number 61, if you are going to the city center - the 96 crosses the river and goes to the Petrzalka area.</p>
<p>The final destination of line 61 is the train station (Hvlaná Stanica), take this bus and exit at the previous stop - Námestie Franza Liszta - (usually there is an information panel inside the bus, if you do not have it and leave the last one it is also not serious - see section how to get there by train). From there cross the pedestrian overpass and take the other side of the street, SAV stop, line 83 or 84 to Hodzovo Námestie, in front of the Presidential Palace.</p>
<p>The other airport access option to the city is Vienna, this time for more stuffed wallets since the non-low cost airlines use this airport as a base in the region. It is equally easy to get from here to the center of Bratislava, just a little more time consuming. There are a lot of buses that leave from the airport of Vienna direct to the center of Bratislava, hardly have to wait more than 1h to catch the following. </p>
<p>The bus stops are just outside the terminal, they will come into contact with them, and for Bratislava all leave from line 4. There are two companies that make the route, Blaguss (promises a journey of about 45 minutes and stops under the SNP Bridge (Novy Most) - next to the river and right at the entrance of the historical center) and Slovak Lines (in about an hour you will be at the bus station in Bratislava - see section how to get there by bus). Both practice similar prices, around 7 euros for a simple trip and 12 for a return trip.</p>

<h2>By Bus:</h2>

<p>Bratislava is connected by train to the main cities of the surrounding countries. I have already mentioned the train trip to Poland, but you can go to Berlin, Prague, Budapest, wherever you want. The journey between Vienna and Bratislava takes about 1 hour and there is practically an hourly train to each side at all hours of the day, leaving Vienna from the Hauptbahnhof and if you take the Vienna-Bratislava-Vienna route on the same day the ticket about of 15 euros still allows you to make two trips in the buses of Bratislava, great to go and return to the center of the city. Arriving there you only have to take line 93 to Hodzovo Námestie or go down the street to the SAV stop and take the 83 or 84 as suggested in the previous section.</p>

<h2>By Car:</h2>
 <p>The bus station, from where most buses coming from outside the city arrive not far from the city center, if you take the trolley 208 or 206 you can leave at the same Námesti Hodzovo mentioned in the previous sections.</p>


<h2>By boat:</h2>

<p>The Danube river runs well in the center of the city of Bratislava, making the arrival by river (there are daily several companies to make the route Vienna - Bratislava - Budapest, some on a connection basis between cities other more cruising style) quite attractive. There are also boat trips on the Danube in the vicinity of the city that depart from the same area, for example to the Castle of Dévin.</p>
<p>Here is a suggestion of a script that can be done in a day or in the middle, depending on the speed of your legs and the calmness with which to visit or not the various churches and small museums that you will find along the way.</p>
<p>Start at Hodzovo Námestie Presidential Palace and head to Hurbanovo Námestie, from there turn right to the Kapucinska area where you have the first view over the castle hill and where you can cross the road to start the climb to the top. At the top you can visit the castle and take beautiful pictures of the Danube and its banks, you can see Austria. Down the opposite side to the base of Novy Most (new bridge, climbed to the top of the bridge at night and yielded some of the photos you can see here), you can then pass by the St. Marti Cathedral, through the garden of Hviezdoslavovo Námestie - where you will also find the old opera - and back to the river. </p>
<p>After a short walk along the Danube you 'come back' into the city to the Blue Church, a small but original church that justifies the small detour there. Returning to the city center you can visit the Priory Palace and the Chamber in the square behind the main square (Hlavné Námestie) and end the day sitting on an esplanade of the lively street that ends at Porta de São Miguel.</p>
