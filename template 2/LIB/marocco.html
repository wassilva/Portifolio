<h2>How to get from Marrakech Airport to the center</h2>

<p>The most common way to get into Morocco is to go by plane with one of several airlines flying from Europe. However, there are also the more adventurous who decide to go from Spain and do a road map of the country. I went by plane, as such I explain here the different ways of getting from Marrakech airport to the center.</p>
<p>Marrakech Airport, designated Menara Airport is 6 km from the city center. This is one of the main ports to visit Morocco and receives thousands of tourists a day.</p>
<p>The Brazilians do not need a visa to enter the country, only a passport that must be valid for at least six months until the end of the stay in the country.</p>
<p>The airport is the only one in the city and is relatively small and simple but very cute.</p>

<h2>Arrival at Marrakech Airport</h2>

<p>Still on the plane, the hostesses distributed a landing card to all passengers. If it's not your case, do not worry. It is possible to fill out when arriving at the airport. On your right side you will find these leaves. The information to be completed on the arrival card is: name, surname, date and place of birth, nationality, country of residence, occupation, passport number, destination, address of accommodation in Morocco and the main reason for travel (mainly tourism) .</p>
<p>A very useful tip: take your passport and a pen by hand. It will save you a lot of time.</p>
<p>After filling in the arrival card, get ready for what comes next: you must pass the passport control. We had more than an hour waiting in line, standing. It is a very slow process and a bit desperate. You will have to go to one of the cabins where you will have to hand in the plane ticket, the passport and the arrival card already filled in. There, the cops analyze all the information.</p>
<p>Stamped passport and here we go. The basement suitcase was already on the conveyors and even there I changed Euros to Dirhams (local currency). The exchange here is favorable, so it pays to do the conversion right there.</p>
<p>In this area there are also some counters with services (mobile phone cards, tranfers, etc.).
We went through an x-ray machine again and finally put the foot out of the airport.</p>



<h2>How to get to the center </h2>

<p>There are several ways to get to the city center, so I'll explain each of them in detail. Bus There is a bus that connects from the airport to the city center (line 19). This is the cheapest option and leaves you in the Jemaa El-Fna Square, the heart of the city. The route passes through the train station and the hotel zone. The trip takes about half an hour. The service runs from 6am to 12.15pm, with a frequency of 30 minutes. The single ticket costs 30 dirhams and you can buy the ticket directly from the driver. For more information, you can check the official Menara Airport website. This was my first choice, but as my Riad was a bit away from the Jemaa El-Fna Square and loaded with suitcases, this option was excluded. However, I think it's a great way to get to the center if you know exactly where your accommodation is.</p>



<h2>Taxi</h2>

<p>This is the most convenient way to get to the center of the city. On leaving the airport you will certainly be confronted with the offers of taxi drivers. These usually ask for 200 dh to make the route.</p>
<p>However, as in everything in Morocco, you can and should haggle over the price. Therefore, you can reach the final value from 70 dh to 100 dh (not more than that) to your accommodation.
Note that most Riads are inside the medina (center of the old town), which is forbidden to cars. The taxi is only a good option if you know how to walk to your accommodation and if you are willing to start haggling soon.</p>

<h2>Transfer</h2>

<p>This is the most convenient solution, and as such I have decided on this option. If you get in touch with your Riad, many are ready to pick you up at the airport for about 150 dh.</p>
<p>However, I found the price a bit exaggerated and researched other ways. I found the Marrakech Airport Transfer company and made the reservation through the internet. We paid 100 dh in total and I think it was the best decision I ever made.</p>
<p>Let me explain: without delay, we already had someone waiting for us that left us as close as possible to the accommodation (as far as the vehicles can go). Here, a man with a large wheelbarrow was waiting for us, who carried our bags to the door of the Riad. No doubt it was impossible to get there by ourselves, since the streets are super narrow and without any indication. Neither the sign with the name of the riad had it. This gentleman asked us for money for this "favor", and we thought it was included in the price of the transfer. We only had a 5-dh coin and that's what we gave. The man found little and began to argue with the owner of our Riad, anyway.</p>
<p>Small but great tip: In Morocco everything is paid, keep this in mind. Most tourists are easy targets for the local population, and as such they take advantage of that. If you arrive at Jemaa El-Fna Square, for example, loaded with luggage and lost air, you will be approached many times to get help to get to your accommodation. Even if it does not ask. In the end, they will charge for this information. They may even give wrong information to get their attention and be helped by them.</p>
<p>Most of these people who try to "help" are kids, alas.</p>
<p>For me, the best option to get from Marrakech airport to the city center is undoubtedly the transfer. Practical, comfortable, safe and not so expensive than the taxi</p>
