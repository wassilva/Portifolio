<h2>WHAT TO DO IN PORTO, PORTUGAL:</h2>

<p>Although there are many tourist attractions when the doubt is what to do in Porto, in Portugal, in two or three days you get to know most of them. This was the time we stayed in the city and it was enough to enjoy. Historical monuments and buildings, charming streets, lookouts, rich gastronomy, wineries and neighboring Vila Nova de Gaia are some of these attractions. We list here our walking tour of the historic center. If it is your first time in the country, we have already published an account of what immigration is like in Portugal so you do not have problems and enter peacefully. </p>

<p>Our day began in the region of the Clérigos Tower, a great starting point for those who want to understand Porto. Climb to the belvedere to enjoy a 360º view of the entire city and region. Just below, on Campo das Mártires da Pátria Street, there are some of the most beautiful and colorful buildings in the city, where several shops operate. Enjoy the delicious cod cake (our cookie) filled with the cream cheese of the Serra da Estrela in Casa Portuguesa. It is more than a mood for the day of walking. Not far away, on the other side of Lisbon Square, is the famous Lello Bookstore, known worldwide for its stairs that inspired the author of Harry Potter. </p>

<h2>REGION OF THE SÃO BENTO STATION</h2> 

<p>Follow Rua dos Clérigos and Praça da Liberdade until the São Bento station, the main one of the city, which has walls covered with tiles and is considered one of the most beautiful in the world. In front of the station is another of the most photogenic corners of the city, with many colorful buildings.  </p> 

<h2>AREA OF TRADE </h2>
<p>From there you can go to Av. Aliados, where is the most traditional shopping area of Porto, and then to Rua Santa Catarina, another important point of commerce for a leisurely ride. This street is also home to an icon of the gastronomy of the city, Café Majestic. The prices are not very low and the seats, well disputed. It is one of the establishments where they recommend to taste the famous Francesinha, perhaps the most typical dish of Porto. If you do not want to pay the highest price of Majestic, we already listed other addresses in this post and explained what that dish is. But you know it's delicious!</p>

<h2>BOLTON MARKET</h2>
<p>Not far from there, it is worth to stop by the Bolhão Market, either to buy a souvenir, have a glass of wine or admire the fruits and other delicacies of the region.</p>
<p>Enjoy, just in front of the market, to eat a cream cake (the pastel of Bethlehem) in the emporium Peróla do Bolhão.</p>
 
<h2>PORTO SEAT</h2>
<p>Back to the São Bento station area, take a break to enjoy the Porto Cathedral, which seems to be overlooking Ribeira and has a beautiful view of the city.</p>
 
<h2>RIBEIRA</h2>
<p>You can not talk about what to do in Porto without soon coming to mind Ribeira, one of the most beautiful regions of the city. Leaving the Sé, follow the beautiful and lively promenade of Rua das Flores to a less than 1km walk through shops and cafés.</p>
<p>In the Ribeira are many restaurants and bars, besides those predinhos with colored balconies that are symbol of the Port. If you prefer, you can buy a bottle of wine and sit right there on the banks of the Douro River, to enjoy the look.</p>
<p>From there, you can also see the Luis I Bridge, built between 1881 and 1888.</p>
 
<h2>VILA NOVA DE GAIA</h2>
<p>Cross the Luis I Bridge towards the neighbor of Vila Nova de Gaia, another city charm. This is where the most famous wine cellars of Porto are located, many open to visitation (learn more).</p>
<p>In Gaia, as it is affectionately called, is where you have one of the most beautiful views of Porto. If you want to sip or eat something, I really enjoyed the Ar de Rio restaurant, which was where I ate my first Francesinha. Aside from the dish being delicious, the view was breathtaking.</p>
<p>Around here most of the attractions border Av. De Diogo Leite, where there are shops, markets and restaurants. And here also where you can take the cable car to the top of the Ponte Luis I. You can know other attractions of Vila Nova de Gaia and what to do there in another post that we already published with tips from the city.</p>
 
<h2>DOUBLE CRUISE WITH WINES</h2>
<p>Unfortunately I did not have time, but many people when thinking about what to do in Porto soon remember the beautiful cruises along the River Douro with wine tasting in the wineries. They say it's really unforgettable and I really want to come back when I go. There are several agencies that do the tour and you can take a look at the best evaluated by the Get Your Guide website. You can quote, schedule the transfer from your hotel and close everything online.</p>
